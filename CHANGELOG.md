# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [3.0.0] - 2019-03-05

### Removed

  - HTTP2 support

    HTTP2 is not useful for [Small Tech](https://ar.al/2019/03/04/small-technology/) as it simply further privileges centralised servers. If you need HTTP2, use [https-server version 2.0.1](https://source.ind.ie/hypha/tools/https-server/tags/2.0.1).

## [2.0.1] - 2019-03-01

### Fixed

  - Remove erroneously-added console log message.

## [2.0.0] - 2019-02-28

### Added

  - HTTP2 support (API-only)

### Changed

  - Command-line arguments: specify port using `--port N`
  - Update `serve` method signature: `serve (pathToServe = '.', callback = null, port = 443)`

### Fixed

  - Start using [semver](https://semver.org/) properly (most of the previous releases should have been minor version bumps.) This is a major bump as there is a backwards-incompatible API change to the serve() method.

## [1.0.7] - 2019-02-28

### Fixed

  - Fix regression with automatic privileged port binding on Linux.

## [1.0.6] - 2019-02-28

### Changed

  - Uses nodecert v1.0.5: certificates now work in Node.js (e.g., via https.get(), etc.).

### Added

  - Unit tests.

## [1.0.5] - 2019-02-27

### Added

  - API: you can now use https-server programmatically from your own Node.js apps. It exposes a `createServer` method thatâ€™s polymorphic with its namesake from the base `https` module and it provides a `serve` convenience method that uses Express to serve a static site at the passed directory and port (or the current directory at port 443 by default).

## [1.0.4] - 2019-02-26

### Changed

  - Uses nodecert v1.0.4 (with progress indication).

## [1.0.3] - 2019-02-26

### Added

  - Node.js is automatically privileged to bind to ports < 1024 (including the default TLS port of 443).

## [1.0.2] - 2019-02-25

### Changed

  - Uses nodecert v1.0.3 with seamless install on macOS as well as Linux.

## [1.0.1] - 2019-02-25

### Fixed

  - Actually serves the requested folder instead of a hardcoded one ðŸ¤¦

### Added

  - Support for manually-specifying the port.

## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-25

Initial release.
