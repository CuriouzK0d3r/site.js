Indie Web Server is a secure and seamless [Small Tech](https://ar.al/2019/03/04/small-technology/) personal web server.

  - Zero-configuration ‚Äì It Just Works ü§û‚Ñ¢.

  - Develop and test with automatically-provisioned locally-trusted TLS thanks to [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) via [Nodecert](https://source.ind.ie/hypha/tools/nodecert).

  - Stage and deploy with automatically-provisioned globally-trusted TLS thanks to [Let‚Äôs Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) via [ACME TLS](https://source.ind.ie/hypha/tools/acme-tls) (with an A score on [SSL Labs SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest)).

[Watch a short 4-minute video](https://ar.al/2019/03/14/introducing-indie-web-server-video/) demonstrating how easy it is to install and use Indie Web Server.

## Install

```sh
npm i -g @ind.ie/web-server
```

## Use

### Command-line

Start serving the current directory at https://localhost:

```shell
$ web-server
```

Start serving the _site_ directory at your hostname:

```shell
$ web-server site --global
```

For example, if you run the command on a connected server that has the ar.al domain pointing to it and `ar.al` set in _/etc/hostname_ (on Unix/Linux/macOS), you will be able to access the site at https://ar.al. The first time you hit it, it will take a little longer to load as your Let‚Äôs Encrypt certificates are being automatically provisioned by ACME TLS.

## Build and test from source

```shell
# Clone and install.
git clone https://source.ind.ie/hypha/tools/web-server.git
cd web-server
npm i -g .

# Run unit tests.
npm test

# Serve the test site (visit https://localhost to view).
web-server test/site
```

#### Syntax

```sh
web-server [folder-to-serve] [--port N] [--global] [--version]
```

All command-line arguments are optional. By default, Indie Web Server will serve your current working folder over port 433 with locally-trusted certificates.

If you specify the `--global` flag, globally-trusted Let‚Äôs Encrypt TLS certificates are automatically provisioned for you using ACME TLS the first time you hit your hostname. The hostname for the certificates is automatically set from the hostname of your system (and the _www._ subdomain is also automatically provisioned).

## Native 404 ‚Üí 302 support for an evergreen web

What if links never died? What if we never broke the Web? What if it didn‚Äôt involve any extra work? It‚Äôs possible. And easy. Just make your 404s into 302s.

Indie Web Server has native support for [the 404 to 302 technique](https://4042302.org) to ensure an evergreen web. Just serve the old version of your site (e.g., your WordPress site, etc.) from a different subdomain and tell Indie Web Server to forward any unknown requests to that subdomain so that all your existing links magically work when you start using Indie Web Server to serve your new static site.

To do so, create a simple file called `4042302` in the root directory of your web content and add the URL of the server that is hosting your older content. e.g.,

#### /4042302
{{<highlight shell>}}
https://the-previous-verison-of.my.site
{{</highlight>}}

You can chain the 404 ‚Üí 302 method any number of times to ensure that none of your links ever break without expending any additional effort to migrate your content.

For more information and examples, see [4042302.org](https://4042302.org).

## Custom error pages

![Screenshot of the custom 404 error page included in the unit tests](images/custom-404.png)

You can specify a custom error page for 404 (not found) and 500 (internal server error) errors. To do so, create a folder with the status code you want off of the root of your web content (i.e., `/404` and/or `/500`) and place at least an `index.html` file in the folder. You can also, optionally, put any assets you want to display on your error pages into those folders and load them in via relative URLs. Your custom error pages will be served with the proper error code and at the URL that was being accessed.

If you do not create custom error pages, the built-in default error pages will be displayed for 404 and 500 errors.

When creating your own servers (see [API](#API)), you can generate the default error pages programmatically using the static methods `WebServer.default404ErrorPage()` and `WebServer.default500ErrorPage()`, passing in the missing path and the error message as the argument, respectively to get the HTML string of the error page returned.

### API

Indie Web Server‚Äôs `createServer` method behaves like the built-in _https_ module‚Äôs `createServer` function. Anywhere you use `require('https').createServer`, you can simply replace it with `require('@ind.ie/web-server').createServer`.


#### createServer([options], [requestListener])

  - __options__ _(object)___:__ see [https.createServer](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_createserver_options_requestlistener). Populates the `cert` and `key` properties from the automatically-created [nodecert](https://source.ind.ie/hypha/tools/nodecert/) or Let‚Äôs Encrypt certificates and will overwrite them if they exist in the options object you pass in. If your options has `options.global = true` set, globally-trusted TLS certificates are obtained from Let‚Äôs Encrypt using ACME TLS.

  - __requestListener__ _(function)___:__ see [https.createServer](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_createserver_options_requestlistener). If you don‚Äôt pass a request listener, Indie Web Server will use its default one.

    __Returns:__ [https.Server](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_class_https_server) instance, configured with either locally-trusted certificates via nodecert or globally-trusted ones from Let‚Äôs Encrypt.

##### Example

```js
const webServer = require('@ind.ie/web-server')
const express = require('express')

const app = express()
app.use(express.static('.'))

const options = {} // to use globally-trusted certificates instead, set this to {global: true}
const server = webServer.createServer(options, app).listen(443, () => {
  console.log(` üéâ Serving on https://localhost\n`)
})
```

#### serve([options])

Options is an optional parameter object that may contain the following properties, all optional:

  - __path__ _(string)___:__ the directory to serve using [Express](http://expressjs.com/).static.

  - __callback__ _(function)___:__ a function to be called when the server is ready. If you do not specify a callback, you can specify the port as the second argument.

  - __port__ _(number)___:__ the port to serve on. Defaults to 443. (On Linux, privileges to bind to the port are automatically obtained for you.)

  - __global__ _(boolean)___:__ if true, globally-trusted Let‚Äôs Encrypt certificates will be provisioned (if necesary) and used via ACME TLS. If false (default), locally-trusted certificates will be provisioned (if necesary) and used using nodecert.

    __Returns:__ [https.Server](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_class_https_server) instance, configured with either locally or globally-trusted certificates.


##### Examples

Serve the current directory at https://localhost using locally-trusted TLS certificates:

```js
const webServer = require('@ind.ie/web-server')
const server = webServer.serve()
```

Serve the current directory at your hostname using globally-trusted Let‚Äôs Encrypt TLS certificates:

```js
const webServer = require('@ind.ie/web-server')
const server = webServer.serve({global: true})
```

## Contributing

Indie Web Server is, by design, a zero-configuration personal web server for single-tenant web applications for and by individuals. As such, as new feature requests will have to be both fit for purpose and survive a trial by fire to be considered. (That is, this is [Small Tech](https://ar.al/2019/03/04/small-technology/), with the emphasis on _small_).

Please file issues and submit pull requests on the [Indie Web Server Github Mirror](https://github.com/indie-mirror/indie-web-server).

## Help wanted

For locally-trusted certificates, all dependencies are installed automatically for you if they do not exist if you have apt, pacman, or yum (untested) on Linux or if you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) (untested) on macOS.

I can use your help to test Indie Web Server on the following platform/package manager combinations:

  - Linux with yum
  - macOS with MacPorts

Please [let me know how/if it works](https://github.com/indie-mirror/web-server/issues). Thank you!

Also, automatic hostname detection has not been implemented for Windows and so globally-trusted certificates will fail on that platform. If you get to it before I do, [I would appreciate a pull request](https://github.com/indie-mirror/web-server/pulls).


## Thanks

  * [thagoat](https://github.com/thagoat) for confirming that [installation works on Arch Linux with Pacman](https://github.com/indie-mirror/https-server/issues/1).

  * [Tim Knip](https://github.com/timknip) for confirming that [the module works with 64-bit Windows](https://github.com/indie-mirror/https-server/issues/2) with the following behaviour: ‚ÄúInstall pops up a windows dialog to allow adding the cert.‚Äù

  * [Run Rabbit Run](https://hackers.town/@nobody) for [the following information](https://hackers.town/@nobody/101670447262172957) on 64-bit Windows: ‚ÄúWin64: works with the windows cert install popup on server launch. Chrome and ie are ok with the site then. FF 65 still throws the cert warning even after restarting.‚Äù
